    "# <u>**Kaggle Credit Fraud Personal Project**</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ### Choose a Kaggle dataset:\n",
    "   - Browse through the Kaggle datasets and select one that interests you.\n",
    "   - Read the dataset description and check the data files and their format.\n",
    "   - Check if there is a publicly available kernel or notebook to get started.\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "2. ### Create a GitHub repository:\n",
    "   - Create a new repository on GitHub to store your project.\n",
    "   - Clone the repository to your local machine and set up the required project structure.\n",
    "   - Create a README file that explains the project, its goals, and how to run it.\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "3. ### Explore the dataset:\n",
    "   - Load the data into a Jupyter notebook and start exploring it.\n",
    "   - Check for missing values, duplicates, and outliers.\n",
    "   - Visualize the data using plots and graphs to gain insights.\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "4. ### Preprocess the data:\n",
    "   - Clean the data by removing missing values, duplicates, and outliers.\n",
    "   - Convert categorical variables into numerical ones using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.\n",
    "   - Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "5. ### Choose and test multiple models:\n",
    "   - Choose different models that are suitable for the problem at hand.\n",
    "   - Train each model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the validation set.\n",
    "   - Hyperparameter tune the models using Optuna to find the best hyperparameters.\n",
    "   - Use unit tests to ensure that the models are behaving as expected.\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "6. ### Choose the best model and evaluate on test set:\n",
    "   - Select the model with the best performance on the validation set.\n",
    "   - Evaluate the selected model on the test set to get an unbiased estimate of its performance.\n",
    "   - Save the trained model and its hyperparameters for future use.\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "7. ### Deploy the model on cloud:\n",
    "   - Create a pipeline using MLflow to track experiments, models, and hyperparameters.\n",
    "   - Package the model and its dependencies into a container using Docker.\n",
    "   - Deploy the container on a cloud provider such as AWS or GCP.\n",
    "   - Expose the deployed model as a REST API to make predictions.\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "8. ### Monitor and update the model:\n",
    "   - Monitor the deployed model for any changes in the input data or the model's behavior.\n",
    "   - Update the model if necessary and re-deploy it.\n",
    "   - Continue to evaluate the model's performance over time and update the hyperparameters as needed.\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "9. ### Add unit tests:\n",
    "   - Write unit tests for the different functions and modules in your project.\n",
    "   - Use a testing framework such as pytest to run the tests automatically.\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "10. ### Document the code:\n",
    "    - Document the code using appropriate comments and docstrings.\n",
    "    - Use a documentation tool such as Sphinx to generate HTML or PDF documentation.\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "11. ### Collaborate with others:\n",
    "    - Invite collaborators to your GitHub repository.\n",
    "    - Use pull requests and code reviews to collaborate and get feedback.\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "12. ### Keep track of changes:\n",
    "    - Use Git to keep track of changes to your code and documentation.\n",
    "    - Commit regularly and use descriptive commit messages.\n",
    "    - Use Git branches to work on new features or experiments.\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "13. ### Follow DevOps practices:\n",
    "    - Use a continuous integration (CI) tool such as Travis CI to automatically build and test your code.\n",
    "    - Use a code quality tool such as CodeClimate to analyze your code and identify potential issues.\n",
    "    - Use a code formatting tool such as Black to maintain consistent code style.\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "14. ### Continuously improve the project:\n",
    "    - Identify areas for improvement and add them to the project backlog.\n",
    "    - Use an agile project management tool such as Trello to prioritize and track tasks.\n",
    "    - Continuously\n",
